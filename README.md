<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a Google Chrome extension that lets you skip all ads on youtube videos by pressing a costomizable keybind (default `Ctrl+End`). Once an add starts playing you can use the shortcut this extension provides and the add will be skipped to the end.

You can customize the shortcut by going into Google Chrome extensions shortcut page (visit `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`) and there you can find and change the keybind.

NOTICE: Chrome keybinds must use Crtl or Alt, for some reason.

If there are multiple ads one after the other you must press the keybind multiple times.

<!-- HOW TO INSTALL -->

## How to install

I won't be bothering publishing the extension on the chrome store to avoid any legal reprocussion with youtube. So if you want to install the extension just download the repository, then:

1. Go to the Extensions page by entering `chrome://extensions` in a new tab
2. Enable **Developer Mode** by clicking the toggle switch in the top right
3. Click the **Load unpacked** button and select this extension's directory

And you're done! You can exit developer mode if you want now.

<!-- WHY DEVELOP THIS -->

## Why develop this

As of mid October 2023 Youtube has started cracking down on the use of ad blockers on its site, requesting users to disable their ad blockers in order to continue watching content.

Now I know there are still some ad-blockers that work and are not yet detected by Youtube's software, but I feel like it's only a matter of time untill all of those will be shut down.

This extension '_solves_' the problem in another way, so I don't see YT blocking this in the near future.<br/>(Actually I don't believe there is a way to completely defend against this approach AT ALL)
